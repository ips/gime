   Now change the initial __run__.sh script to run your game. You have time
   to configure your game and apply patches. After that unmount this dir.


   The mounted image directory is imagename-mnt.


   To unmount type sudo unmount imagename-mnt, if you want to prepare the
   image for distribution or just make it smaller, type: ./gime-lzma imagename


   Mounting again is simple. Type ./gime-mount imagename - if you used
   gime-lzma tool before, or you downloaded image from internet it will
   be decompressed first. This can take an long time, but is 2x faster
   than compression ( ./gime-lzma ).
